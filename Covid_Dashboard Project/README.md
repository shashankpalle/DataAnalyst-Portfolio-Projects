# Covid Dashboard

In this work, I have used covid data in Tableau to give an overview of covid impacts around the world.

## Dataset 

I have used a covid dataset containing covid information from 2019 - 2022 from here - https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

## Data Exploration 

COVIDqueries.sql contains sql queries performed on the COVID dataset to find some interesting insights about impacts of COVID.

## Covid Tableau Dashboard

Using the tables from the queries in COVIDqueries.sql, I have made a tableau dashboard which you may find interesting!
